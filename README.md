# Hello

This is my second attempt at a VST. This one is much better than the first. 

This is composed of several effects plus a visual in the center.

The rotary sliders on the top do stereo width, panning, and mid.

The sliders on the side are hard clippers, one for the left audio and one for the right audio.

The rotary sliders on the bottom are the same as on the top, except that they process the audio 
after the sliders on the side as opposed to before. 

The blue diamond represents where a sample would be if either the left or the right exceeds 0db. 
If any part of the left or right exceeds this, it gets cut off by the visual, but not necessarily clipped
unless you pull down the clip slider for that.


Here is a simple demonstration of the current build of the plugin: https://youtu.be/o_GDnC3Xpjk
